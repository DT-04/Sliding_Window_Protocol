# Sliding Window Protocol Simulation

A visually engaging and interactive simulation of **Sliding Window Protocol** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The project demonstrates two major variants of the protocol used in Computer Networks:

- **Go-Back-N ARQ**
- **Selective Repeat ARQ**

This project is designed to help students, educators, and networking enthusiasts understand how data packets are sent, acknowledged, and retransmitted in these protocols.
